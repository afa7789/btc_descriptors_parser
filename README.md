# Descriptors Derivation/Decoding

# Disclaimer

This was really hard, so I used LLM to finish it.
I don't think it's worth doing this in .c , probably better to do it in python and to use libs people already made to do it.
It was really hard to find how to derive and decode/encode things, not a quick trip to the mall, so better to stick to built tools in this case I guess.
